      <span class="bold">Foreword</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">As a reviewer I got an early opportunity to read the book you are holding. It was great, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">even in draft form. Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt have something to say, and they know </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">how to say it. I saw what they were doing and I knew it would work. I asked to write this </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">foreword so that I could explain why. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Simply put, this book tells you how to program in a way that you can follow. You wouldn't </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">think that that would be a hard thing to do, but it is. Why? For one thing, not all </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">programming books are written by programmers. Many are compiled by language </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">designers, or the journalists who work with them to promote their creations. Those books </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">tell you how to <span class="italic">talk</span> in a programming language—which is certainly important, but that is</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">only a small part of what a programmer does. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">What does a programmer do besides talk in programming language? Well, that is a deeper </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">issue. Most programmers would have trouble explaining what they do. Programming is a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">job filled with details, and keeping track of those details requires focus. Hours drift by and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the code appears. You look up and there are all of those statements. If you don't think </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">carefully, you might think that programming is just typing statements in a programming </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">language. You would be wrong, of course, but you wouldn't be able to tell by looking </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">around the programming section of the bookstore. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In <span class="italic">The Pragmatic Programmer</span> Dave and Andy tell us how to program in a way that we</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">can follow. How did they get so smart? Aren't they just as focused on details as other</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">programmers? The answer is that they paid attention to what they were doing while they</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">were doing it—and then they tried to do it better. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Imagine that you are sitting in a meeting. Maybe you are thinking that the meeting could go </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on forever and that you would rather be programming. Dave and Andy would be thinking </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">about why they were having the meeting, and wondering if there is something else they </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">could do that would take the place of the meeting, and deciding if that something could be </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">automated so that the work of the meeting just happens in the future. Then they would do </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">it. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">That is just the way Dave and Andy think. That meeting wasn't something keeping them </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">from programming. It <span class="italic">was</span> programming. And it was programming that could be improved. I </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">know they think this way because it is tip number two: Think About Your Work. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">So imagine that these guys are thinking this way for a few years. Pretty soon they would </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">have a collection of solutions. Now imagine them using their solutions in their work for a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">few more years, and discarding the ones that are too hard or don't always produce results. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Well, that approach just about defines <span class="italic">pragmatic. </span> Now imagine them taking a year or two </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">more to write their solutions down. You might think, <span class="italic">That information would be a gold </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">mine. </span> And you would be right. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The authors tell us how they program. And they tell us in a way that we can follow. But </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">there is more to this second statement than you might think. Let me explain. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The authors have been careful to avoid proposing a theory of software development. This </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">is fortunate, because if they had they would be obliged to warp each chapter to defend </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">their theory. Such warping is the tradition in, say, the physical sciences, where theories </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">eventually become laws or are quietly discarded. Programming on the other hand has few </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">(if any) laws. So programming advice shaped around wanna-be laws may sound good in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">writing, but it fails to satisfy in practice. This is what goes wrong with so many methodology </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">books. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">I've studied this problem for a dozen years and found the most promise in a device called a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">pattern language. </span> In short, a <span class="italic">pattern</span> is a solution, and a pattern language is a system of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">solutions that reinforce each other. A whole community has formed around the search for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">these systems. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This book is more than a collection of tips. It is a pattern language in sheep's clothing. I say </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that because each tip is drawn from experience, told as concrete advice, and related to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">others to form a system. These are the characteristics that allow us to learn and follow a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">pattern language. They work the same way here. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You can follow the advice in this book because it is concrete. You won't find vague </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">abstractions. Dave and Andy write directly for you, as if each tip was a vital strategy for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">energizing your programming career. They make it simple, they tell a story, they use a light </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">touch, and then they follow that up with answers to questions that will come up when you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">try. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">And there is more. After you read ten or fifteen tips you will begin to see an extra </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">dimension to the work. We sometimes call it <span class="italic">QWAN, </span> short for the <span class="italic">quality without a name. </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The book has a philosophy that will ooze into your consciousness and mix with your own. It </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">doesn't preach. It just tells what works. But in the telling more comes through. That's the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">beauty of the book: It embodies its philosophy, and it does so unpretentiously. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <img class="calibre_6" src="images/00193.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <img class="calibre_1" src="images/00122.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">So here it is: an easy to read—and use—book about the whole practice of programming. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">I've gone on and on about why it works. You probably only care that it does work. It does. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You will see. </p>

      <span class="bold">Preface</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This book will help you become a better programmer. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It doesn't matter whether you are a lone developer, a member of a large project team, or a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">consultant working with many clients at once. This book will help you, as an individual, to</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">do better work. This book isn't theoretical—we concentrate on practical topics, on using</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your experience to make more informed decisions. The word <span class="italic">pragmatic</span> comes from the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Latin <span class="italic">pragmaticus—</span>"skilled in business"—which itself is derived from the Greek</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">, meaning "to do." This is a book about doing. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a computer to do what you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As a programmer, you are part listener, part </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">advisor, part interpreter, and part dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">a way of expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to engineer your work so </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that others can build on it. What's more, you try to do all this against the relentless ticking </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of the project clock. You work small miracles every day. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It's a difficult job. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There are many people offering you help. Tool vendors tout the miracles their products </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">perform. Methodology gurus promise that their techniques guarantee results. Everyone </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">claims that their programming language is the best, and every operating system is the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">answer to all conceivable ills. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Of course, none of this is true. There are no easy answers. There is no such thing as a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">best</span> solution, be it a tool, a language, or an operating system. There can only be systems </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This is where pragmatism comes in. You shouldn't be wedded to any particular technology, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">but have a broad enough background and experience base to allow you to choose good </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">solutions in particular situations. Your background stems from an understanding of the </p>

      <span class="bold">What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Each developer is unique, with individual strengths and weaknesses, preferences and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">dislikes. Over time, each will craft his or her own personal environment. That environment </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">will reflect the programmer's individuality just as forcefully as his or her hobbies, clothing, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">or haircut. However, if you're a Pragmatic Programmer, you'll share many of the following </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">characteristics:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Early adopter/fast adapter. </span> You have an instinct for technologies and</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">techniques, and you love trying things out. When given something new, you can </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your knowledge. Your confidence is </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">born of experience. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Inquisitive. </span> You tend to ask questions. <span class="italic">That's neat—how did you do that? Did</span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">you have problems with that library? What's this BeOS I've heard about? How</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">are symbolic links implemented? </span> You are a pack rat for little facts, each of which </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">may affect some decision years from now. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Critical thinker. </span> You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When colleagues say "because that's the way it's done," or a vendor promises the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">solution to all your problems, you smell a challenge. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Realistic. </span> You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">will take. Understanding for yourself that a process <span class="italic">should</span> be difficult or <span class="italic">will</span> take a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">while to complete gives you the stamina to keep at it. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Jack of all trades. </span> You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and environments, and you work to keep abreast of new developments. Although </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on to new areas and new challenges. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We've left the most basic characteristics until last. All Pragmatic Programmers share them. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">They're basic enough to state as tips:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Tip 1</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <img class="calibre_1" src="images/00278.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Care About Your Craft</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Tip 2</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Think! About Your Work</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we're challenging you to think about what you're</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">doing while you're doing it. This isn't a one-time audit of current practices—it's an ongoing</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">critical appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every development. Never</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">run on auto-pilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time. The old IBM</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">corporate motto, THINK!, is the Pragmatic Programmer's mantra. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If this sounds like hard work to you, then you're exhibiting the <span class="italic">realistic</span> characteristic. This</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">is going to take up some of your valuable time—time that is probably already under</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">tremendous pressure. The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love, a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a feeling of</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">continuous improvement. Over the long term, your time investment will be repaid as you</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and your team become more efficient, write code that's easier to maintain, and spend less</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">time in meetings. </p>

      <span class="bold">Individual Pragmatists, Large Teams</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Some people feel that there is no room for individuality on large teams or complex projects. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">"Software construction is an engineering discipline," they say, "that breaks down if </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">individual team members make decisions for themselves." </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We disagree. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The construction of software <span class="italic">should</span> be an engineering discipline. However, this doesn't </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">preclude individual craftsmanship. Think about the large cathedrals built in Europe during </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the Middle Ages. Each took thousands of person-years of effort, spread over many </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">decades. Lessons learned were passed down to the next set of builders, who advanced </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the state of structural engineering with their accomplishments. But the carpenters, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">stonecutters, carvers, and glass workers were all craftspeople, interpreting the engineering </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">requirements to produce a whole that transcended the purely mechanical side of the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">construction. It was their belief in their individual contributions that sustained the projects:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">—<span class="bold">Quarry worker's creed</span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">craftsmanship. This is particularly true given the current state of software engineering. One </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">medieval cathedral builders seem to today's civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">still be honored. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">A tourist visiting England's Eton College asked the gardener how he got the lawns so </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">perfect. "That's easy," he replied, "You just brush off the dew every morning, mow </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">them every other day, and roll them once a week." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">"Is that all?" asked the tourist. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">"Absolutely," replied the gardener. "Do that for 500 years and you'll have a nice lawn, </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">too." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Great lawns need small amounts of daily care, and so do great programmers. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Management consultants like to drop the word <span class="italic">kaizen</span> in conversations. "Kaizen" is a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Japanese term that captures the concept of continuously making many small </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">improvements. It was considered to be one of the main reasons for the dramatic gains in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">productivity and quality in Japanese manufacturing and was widely copied throughout the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">world. Kaizen applies to individuals, too. Every day, work to refine the skills you have and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to add new tools to your repertoire. Unlike the Eton lawns, you'll start seeing results in a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">matter of days. Over the years, you'll be amazed at how your experience has blossomed </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">English words that have been corrupted to mean something technical, or horrendous</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">made-up words that have been assigned meanings by computer scientists with a grudge</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">against the language. The first time we use each of these jargon words, we try to define it, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">or at least give a hint to its meaning. However, we're sure that some have fallen through</p>

    <p class="calibre_2">maybe in a computer science textbook. And, if you get a chance, drop us an e-mail and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">complain, so we can add a definition to the next edition. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Having said all this, we decided to get revenge against the computer scientists. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Sometimes, there are perfectly good jargon words for concepts, words that we've decided</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to ignore. Why? Because the existing jargon is normally restricted to a particular problem</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">domain, or to a particular phase of development. However, one of the basic philosophies of</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">this book is that most of the techniques we're recommending are universal: modularity</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">applies to code, designs, documentation, and team organization, for instance. When we</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">wanted to use the conventional jargon word in a broader context, it got confusing—we</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">couldn't seem to overcome the baggage the original term brought with it. When this</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">happened, we contributed to the decline of the language by inventing our own terms. </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When we started writing this book, we had no idea how much of a team effort it would end </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">up being. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Addison-Wesley has been brilliant, taking a couple of wet-behind-the-ears hackers and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">walking us through the whole book-production process, from idea to camera-ready copy. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Many thanks to John Wait and Meera Ravindiran for their initial support, Mike Hendrickson, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">our enthusiastic editor (and a mean cover designer!), Lorraine Ferrier and John Fuller for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">their help with production, and the indefatigable Julie DeBaggis for keeping us all together. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Then there were the reviewers: Greg Andress, Mark Cheers, Chris Cleeland, Alistair </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, Thanh T. Giang, Robert L. Glass, Scott </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Henninger, Michael Hunter, Brian Kirby, John Lakos, Pete McBreen, Carey P. Morris, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Jared Richardson, Kevin Ruland, Eric Starr, Eric Vought, Chris Van Wyk, and Deborra </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Zukowski. Without their careful comments and valuable insights, this book would be less </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">readable, less accurate, and twice as long. Thank you all for your time and wisdom. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The second printing of this book benefited greatly from the eagle eyes of our readers. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Many thanks to Brian Blank, Paul Boal, Tom Ekberg, Brent Fulgham, Louis Paul Hebert, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Henk-Jan Olde Loohuis, Alan Lund, Gareth McCaughan, Yoshiki Shibata, and Volker </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Wurst, both for finding the mistakes and for having the grace to point them out gently. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Over the years, we have worked with a large number of progressive clients, where we </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">gained and refined the experience we write about here. Recently, we've been fortunate to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">work with Peter Gehrke on several large projects. His support and enthusiasm for our </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">techniques are much appreciated. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This book was produced using LATEX, pic, Perl, dvips, ghostview, ispell, GNU make, CVS, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Emacs, XEmacs, EGCS, GCC, Java, iContract, and SmallEiffel, using the Bash and zsh </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">shells under Linux. The staggering thing is that all of this tremendous software is freely </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">available. We owe a huge "thank you" to the thousands of Pragmatic Programmers </p>

      <span class="bold">Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers? We feel it's an attitude, a style, a philosophy </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of approaching problems and their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">always trying to place it in its larger context, always trying to be aware of the bigger picture. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">After all, without this larger context, how can you be pragmatic? How can you make </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">intelligent compromises and informed decisions? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Another key to their success is that they take responsibility for everything they do, which </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">we discuss in <span class="italic">The Cat Ate My Source Code. </span> Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">won't sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect. In <span class="italic">Software Entropy, </span> we </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">tell you how to keep your projects pristine. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Most people find change difficult to accept, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">because of plain old inertia. In <span class="italic">Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs, </span> we look at a strategy for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">instigating change and (in the interests of balance) present the cautionary tale of an </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">amphibian that ignored the dangers of gradual change. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">One of the benefits of understanding the context in which you work is that it becomes </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">easier to know just how good your software has to be. Sometimes near-perfection is the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">only option, but often there are trade-offs involved. We explore this in <span class="italic">Good-Enough </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">Software. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Of course, you need to have a broad base of knowledge and experience to pull all of this </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">off. Learning is a continuous and ongoing process. In <span class="italic">Your Knowledge Portfolio, </span> we </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">discuss some strategies for keeping the momentum up. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Finally, none of us works in a vacuum. We all spend a large amount of time interacting with </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">others. <span class="italic">Communicate! </span> lists ways we can do this better. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Pragmatic programming stems from a philosophy of pragmatic thinking. This chapter sets </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the basis for that philosophy. </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">One of the cornerstones of the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking responsibility for</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">yourself and your actions in terms of your career advancement, your project, and your</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">day-to-day work. A Pragmatic Programmer takes charge of his or her own career, and isn't</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">afraid to admit ignorance or error. It's not the most pleasant aspect of programming, to be</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">sure, but it will happen—even on the best of projects. Despite thorough testing, good</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">documentation, and solid automation, things go wrong. Deliveries are late. Unforeseen</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">technical problems come up. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">These things happen, and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. This</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">means being honest and direct. We can be proud of our abilities, but we must be honest</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">about our shortcomings—our ignorance as well as our mistakes. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Take Responsibility</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Responsibility is something you actively agree to. You make a commitment to ensure that </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">something is done right, but you don't necessarily have direct control over every aspect of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">it. In addition to doing your own personal best, you must analyze the situation for risks that </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">are beyond your control. You have the right <span class="italic">not</span> to take on a responsibility for an impossible </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">situation, or one in which the risks are too great. You'll have to make the call based on your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">own ethics and judgment. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When you <span class="italic">do</span> accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">accountable for it. When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">honestly and try to offer options. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don't blame all the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and all of these may play a role, but it is up to <span class="italic">you</span> to provide solutions, not excuses. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn't come through for you, then you should have</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">had a contingency plan. If the disk crashes—taking all of your source code with it—and you</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">don't have a backup, it's your fault. Telling your boss<a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline"> "the cat ate my source code" just </span></span></a></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">won't cut it. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Tip 3</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can't be done, is late, or is </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How's it going to sound to your boss? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person likely to say? Will</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">they ask, "Have you tried this…" or "Didn't you consider that?" How will you respond? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else you can try? Sometimes, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you just <span class="italic">know</span> what they are going to say, so save them the trouble. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what <span class="italic">can</span> be done </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to salvage the situation. Does code have to be thrown out? Educate them on the value of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">refactoring (see <a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">Refactoring</span></span></a>). Do you need to spend time prototyping to determine the best </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">way to proceed (see Prototypes and Post-it Notes</span></span></a>)? Do you need to introduce better </p>

        </span>
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">resources. Don't be afraid to ask, or to admit that you need help. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Try to flush out the lame excuses before voicing them aloud. If you must, tell your cat first. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">After all, if little Tiddles is going to take the blame…. </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">While software development is immune from almost all physical laws, <span class="italic">entropy</span> hits us hard. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Entropy</span> is a term from physics that refers to the amount of "disorder" in a system. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that the entropy in the universe </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">tends toward a maximum. When disorder increases in software, programmers call it </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">"software rot." </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There are many factors that can contribute to software rot. The most important one seems </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to be the psychology, or culture, at work on a project. Even if you are a team of one, your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">project's psychology can be a very delicate thing. Despite the best laid plans and the best </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">people, a project can still experience ruin and decay during its lifetime. Yet there are other </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">projects that, despite enormous difficulties and constant setbacks, successfully fight </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">nature's tendency toward disorder and manage to come out pretty well. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">What makes the difference? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In inner cities, some buildings are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulks. Why? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Researchers in the field of crime and urban decay discovered a fascinating trigger </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">mechanism, one that very quickly turns a clean, intact, inhabited building into a smashed </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="calibre_5">
        <span class="underline">and abandoned derelict [WK82]. </span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">A broken window. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers that be don't</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the building</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">becomes reality. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The "Broken Window Theory" has inspired police departments in New York and other </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">major cities to crack down on the small stuff in order to keep out the big stuff. It works: </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">keeping on top of broken windows, graffiti, and other small infractions has reduced the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">serious crime level. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Tip 4</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Don't Live with Broken Windows</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">board it up. </span> Perhaps you can comment out the offending code, or display a "Not </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take <span class="italic">some</span> action to prevent </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">further damage and to show that you're on top of the situation. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We've seen clean, functional systems deteriorate pretty quickly once windows start </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">breaking. There are other factors that can contribute to software rot, and we'll touch on </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">some of them elsewhere, but neglect <span class="italic">accelerates</span> the rot faster than any other factor. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You may be thinking that no one has the time to go around cleaning up all the broken glass </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of a project. If you continue to think like that, then you'd better plan on getting a dumpster, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">or moving to another neighborhood. Don't let entropy win. </p>

      <span class="bold">Putting Out Fires</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">By contrast, there's the story of an obscenely rich acquaintance of Andy's. His house was </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">immaculate, beautiful, loaded with priceless antiques, <span class="italic">objets d'art, </span> and so on. One day, a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">tapestry that was hanging a little too close to his living room fireplace caught on fire. The</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged their</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a mat</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">between the front door and the source of the fire. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">They didn't want to mess up the carpet. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">A pretty extreme case, to be sure, but that's the way it must be with software. One broken</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">window—a badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision that the team must</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">live with for the duration of the project— is all it takes to start the decline. If you find</p>

    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">years of war, the villagers were short of food, and hoarded what they had. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">Undeterred, the soldiers boiled a pot of water and carefully placed three stones into it. </span>

      <span class="italic">The amazed villagers came out to watch. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">"This is stone soup," the soldiers explained. "Is that all you put in it?" asked the</span>

    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">villagers. "Absolutely—although some say it tastes even better with a few carrots…." A</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">villager ran off, returning in no time with a basket of carrots from his hoard. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">A couple of minutes later, the villagers again asked "Is that it?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">"Well," said the soldiers, "a couple of potatoes give it body." Off ran another villager. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">Over the next hour, the soldiers listed more ingredients that would enhance the soup: </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">beef, leeks, salt, and herbs. Each time a different villager would run off to raid their </span>

      <span class="italic">personal stores. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">Eventually they had produced a large pot of steaming soup. The soldiers removed the </span>

      <span class="italic">stones, and they sat down with the entire village to enjoy the first square meal any of </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">them had eaten in months. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There are a couple of morals in the stone soup story. The villagers are tricked by the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">soldiers, who use the villagers' curiosity to get food from them. But more importantly, the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together so they can jointly produce</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">something that they couldn't have done by themselves—a synergistic result. Eventually</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">everyone wins. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Every now and then, you might want to emulate the soldiers. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. The</p>

    <p class="calibre_2">tackle the whole thing and you'll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">guard their own resources. Sometimes this is called "start-up fatigue." </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It's time to bring out the stones. Work out what you <span class="italic">can</span> reasonably ask for. Develop it well. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say "of course, it <span class="italic">would</span> be</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">better if we added…." Pretend it's not important. Sit back and wait for them to start asking</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you to add the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing</p>

    <p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, the stone soup story is also about gentle and gradual deception. It's </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">about focusing too tightly. The villagers think about the stones and forget about the rest of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the world. We all fall for it, every day. Things just creep up on us. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We've all seen the symptoms. Projects slowly and inexorably get totally out of hand. Most </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">water, then gradually heat it, the frog won't notice the slow increase in temperature and will</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">stay put until cooked. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">chip in 10,000. A few weeks later the order arrived: one large box containing thousands of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">ICs, and a small one containing just ten. Attached to the small box was a label that read: </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">"These are the faulty ones." </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If only we really had this kind of control over quality. But the real world just won't let us </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">However, this doesn't have to be frustrating. As Ed Yourdon described in an article in <span class="italic">IEEE </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Software</span><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline"> [You95], you can discipline yourself to write software that's good enough—goo</span></span>d</p>

    <p class="calibre_2">you are more productive and your users are happier. And you may well find that your</p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Before we go any further, we need to qualify what we're about to say. The phrase "good </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">be more stringent and your options more limited. However, if you're working on a brand </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">new product, you'll have different constraints. The marketing people will have promises to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">keep, the eventual end users may have made plans based on a delivery schedule, and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your company will certainly have cash-flow constraints. It would be unprofessional to ignore </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">these users' requirements simply to add new features to the program, or to polish up the </p>

      <span class="bold">Know When to Stop</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">do with them. You sketch out an overall shape, paint the underlying environment, then fill in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the details. You constantly step back with a critical eye to view what you've done. Every </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">now and then you'll throw a canvas away and start again. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">But artists will tell you that all the hard work is ruined if you don't know when to stop. If you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">add layer upon layer, detail over detail, <span class="italic">the painting becomes lost in the paint. </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and over-refinement. Move on, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and let your code stand in its own right for a while. It may not be perfect. Don't worry: it </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">could never be perfect. (In <a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">Chapter 6</span></span></a>, we'll discuss philosophies for developing code in an </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Ah, good old Ben Franklin—never at a loss for a pithy homily. Why, if we could just be early</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to bed and early to rise, we'd be great programmers—right? The early bird might get the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">worm, but what happens to the early worm? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In this case, though, Ben really hit the nail on the head. Your knowledge and experience </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">are your most important professional assets. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, they're <span class="italic">expiring assets. </span><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">[3]</span></span></a> Your knowledge becomes out of date as new</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">techniques, languages, and environments are developed. Changing market forces may </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">render your experience obsolete or irrelevant. Given the speed at which Web-years fly by, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">this can happen pretty quickly. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">[3] An <span class="italic">expiring asset</span> is something whose value diminishes over time. Examples include a warehouse full </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of bananas and a ticket to a ball game. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">As the value of your knowledge declines, so does your value to your company or client. We</p>

      <span class="bold">Your Knowledge Portfolio</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">domains they work in, and all their experience as their <span class="italic">Knowledge Portfolios. </span> Managing a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">2. Diversification is the key to long-term success. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">high-reward investments. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">To be successful in your career, you must manage your knowledge portfolio using these </p>

      <span class="bold">Building Your Portfolio</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Invest regularly. </span> Just as in financial investing, you must invest in your</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">knowledge portfolio <span class="italic">regularly. </span> Even if it's just a small amount, the habit itself is as </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">important as the sums. A few sample goals are listed in the next section. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Diversify. </span> The more <span class="italic">different</span> things you know, the more valuable you are. As a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the particular technology you are</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">working with currently. But don't stop there. The face of computing changes</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">rapidly—hot technology today may well be close to useless (or at least not in</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">demand) tomorrow. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">will be able to adjust to change. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Manage risk. </span> Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentially</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It's not a good idea to invest all of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don't put all your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">technical eggs in one basket. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Buy low, sell high. </span> Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">rewarding. Learning Java when it first came out may have been risky, but it paid off </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">handsomely for the early adopters who are now at the top of that field. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Review and rebalance. </span> This is a very dynamic industry. That hot technology</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you started investigating last month might be stone cold by now. Maybe you need</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to brush up on that database technology that you haven't used in a while. Or</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">perhaps you could be better positioned for that new job opening if you tried out that</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">other language…. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Of all these guidelines, the most important one is the simplest to do:</p>

      <span class="bold">Goals</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Now that you have some guidelines on what and when to add to your knowledge portfolio, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">what's the best way to go about acquiring intellectual capital with which to fund your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">portfolio? Here are a few suggestions. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Learn at least one new language every year. </span> Different languages solve the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut. Additionally, learning </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">many languages is far easier now, thanks to the wealth of freely available software </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on the Internet (see page 267). </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Read a technical book each quarter. </span> Bookstores are full of technical books on</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">interesting topics related to your current project. Once you're in the habit, read a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">book a month. After you've mastered the technologies you're currently using, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">branch out and study some that <span class="italic">don't</span> relate to your project. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Read nontechnical books, too. </span> It is important to remember that computers are</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">used by <span class="italic">people</span>—people whose needs you are trying to satisfy. Don't forget the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">human side of the equation. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Take classes. </span> Look for interesting courses at your local community college or</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">university, or perhaps at the next trade show that comes to town. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Participate in local user groups. </span> Don't just go and listen, but actively</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">participate. Isolation can be deadly to your career; find out what people are working </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on outside of your company. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Experiment with different environments. </span> If you've worked only in Windows, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">play with Unix at home (the freely available Linux is perfect for this). If you've used </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">only makefiles and an editor, try an IDE, and vice versa. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Stay current. </span> Subscribe to trade magazines and other journals (see page 262 for</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">recommendations). Choose some that cover technology different from that of your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">current project. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Get wired. </span> Want to know the ins and outs of a new language or other</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">technology? Newsgroups are a great way to find out what experiences other </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">people are having with it, the particular jargon they use, and so on. Surf the Web </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">for papers, commercial sites, and any other sources of information you can find. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It's important to continue investing. Once you feel comfortable with some new language or </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">bit of technology, move on. Learn another one. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It doesn't matter whether you ever use any of these technologies on a project, or even </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">whether you put them on your resume. The process of learning will expand your thinking, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things. The cross-pollination of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">ideas is important; try to apply the lessons you've learned to your current project. Even if </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your project doesn't use that technology, perhaps you can borrow some ideas. Get familiar </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">with object orientation, for instance, and you'll write plain C programs differently. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Maybe we can learn a lesson from Ms. West. It's not just what you've got, but also how you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">package it. Having the best ideas, the finest code, or the most pragmatic thinking is </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">ultimately sterile unless you can communicate with other people. A good idea is an orphan </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">without effective communication. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">As developers, we have to communicate on many levels. We spend hours in meetings, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">listening and talking. We work with end users, trying to understand their needs. We write </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">code, which communicates our intentions to a machine and documents our thinking for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">future generations of developers. We write proposals and memos requesting and justifying </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">resources, reporting our status, and suggesting new approaches. And we work daily within </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">our teams to advocate our ideas, modify existing practices, and suggest new ones. A large </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Probably the most difficult part of the more formal styles of communication used in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">business is working out exactly what it is you want to say. Fiction writers plot out their </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often happy to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">sit down at a keyboard, enter "1. Introduction," and start typing whatever comes into their </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, "Does this get across </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">whatever I'm trying to say?" Refine it until it does. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This approach is not just applicable to writing documents. When you're faced with an </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">important meeting or a phone call with a major client, jot down the ideas you want to </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">their priorities are. Catch a manager who's just been given a hard time by her boss</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">because some source code got lost, and you'll have a more receptive listener to your ideas</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on source code repositories. Make what you're saying relevant in time, as well as in</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">content. Sometimes all it takes is the simple question "Is this a good time to talk about…?" </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Choose a Style</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Some people want a formal "just the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">facts" briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. When </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">it comes to written documents, some like to receive large bound reports, while others </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">expect a simple memo or e-mail. If in doubt, ask. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Remember, however, that you are half of the communication transaction. If someone says </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">they need a paragraph describing something and you can't see any way of doing it in less </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">than several pages, tell them so. Remember, that kind of feedback is a form of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">communication, too. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Make It Look Good</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">audience. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Too many developers (and their managers) concentrate solely on content when producing </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">written documents. We think this is a mistake. Any chef will tell you that you can slave in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the kitchen for hours only to ruin your efforts with poor presentation. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There is no excuse today for producing poor-looking printed documents. Modern word </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">processors (along with layout systems such as LaTeX and troff) can produce stunning </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">output. You need to learn just a few basic commands. If your word processor supports </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">style sheets, use them. (Your company may already have defined style sheets that you can </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">use.) Learn how to set page headers and footers. Look at the sample documents included </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">with your package to get ideas on style and layout. <span class="italic">Check the spelling, </span> first automatically </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and then by hand. After awl, their are spelling miss steaks that the chequer can knot ketch. </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We often find that the documents we produce end up being less important than the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">process we go through to produce them. If possible, involve your readers with early drafts </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You'll build a good working </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">relationship, and you'll probably produce a better document in the process. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Be a Listener</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There's one technique that you must use if you want people to listen to you: <span class="italic">listen to them. </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Even if this is a situation where you have all the information, even if this is a formal</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don't listen to them, they won't listen</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to you. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or have them summarize what you tell them. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you'll make your point more effectively. Who knows, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you might even learn something. </p>

      <span class="bold">Get Back to People</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If you ask someone a question, you feel they're impolite if they don't respond. But how </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">often do you fail to get back to people when they send you an e-mail or a memo asking for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">information or requesting some action? In the rush of everyday life, it's easy to forget. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Always respond to e-mails and voice mails, even if the response is simply "I'll get back to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you later." Keeping people informed makes them far more forgiving of the occasional slip, </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There are certain tips and tricks that apply at all levels of software development, ideas that </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">are almost axiomatic, and processes that are virtually universal. However, these </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">approaches are rarely documented as such; you'll mostly find them written down as odd </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">sentences in discussions of design, project management, or coding. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In this chapter we'll bring these ideas and processes together. The first two sections, <span class="italic">The </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Evils of Duplication</span> and <span class="italic">Orthogonality, </span> are closely related. The first warns you not to </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">knowledge across multiple system components. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">As the pace of change increases, it becomes harder and harder to keep our applications </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">from their changing environment. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The next two sections are also related. In <span class="italic">Tracer Bullets, </span> we talk about a style of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">development that allows you to gather requirements, test designs, and implement code at </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the same time. If this sounds too good to be true, it is: tracer bullet developments are not </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">always applicable. When they're not, <span class="italic">Prototypes and Post-it Notes</span> shows you how to use </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">prototyping to test architectures, algorithms, interfaces, and ideas. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">As computer science slowly matures, designers are producing increasingly higher-level </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">languages. While the compiler that accepts "make it so" hasn't yet been invented, in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Domain Languages</span> we present some more modest suggestions that you can implement </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Giving a computer two contradictory pieces of knowledge was Captain James T. Kirk's </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">preferred way of disabling a marauding artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the same </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">principle can be effective in bringing down <span class="italic">your</span> code. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">As programmers, we collect, organize, maintain, and harness knowledge. We document </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">knowledge in specifications, we make it come alive in running code, and we use it to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">provide the checks needed during testing. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, knowledge isn't stable. It changes—often rapidly. Your understanding of a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">requirement may change following a meeting with the client. The government changes a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">regulation and some business logic gets outdated. Tests may show that the chosen</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">algorithm won't work. All this instability means that we spend a large part of our time in</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">maintenance mode, reorganizing and reexpressing the knowledge in our systems. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Most people assume that maintenance begins when an application is released, that </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">maintenance means fixing bugs and enhancing features. We think these people are wrong. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Programmers are constantly in maintenance mode. Our understanding changes day by </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">day. New requirements arrive as we're designing or coding. Perhaps the environment </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">changes. Whatever the reason, maintenance is not a discrete activity, but a routine part of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the entire development process. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When we perform maintenance, we have to find and change the representations of</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">things—those capsules of knowledge embedded in the application. The problem is that it's</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">easy to duplicate knowledge in the specifications, processes, and programs that we</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">develop, and when we do so, we invite a maintenance nightmare—one that starts well</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">before the application ships. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We feel that the only way to develop software reliably, and to make our developments </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">easier to understand and maintain, is to follow what we call the <span class="italic">DRY</span> principle:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">tools in the Pragmatic Programmer's tool box. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In this section we'll outline the problems of duplication and suggest general strategies for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">dealing with it. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">How Does Duplication Arise? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Most of the duplication we see falls into one of the following categories:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Imposed duplication. </span> Developers feel they have no choice—the environment</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">seems to require duplication. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Inadvertent duplication. </span> Developers don't realize that they are duplicating</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">information. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Impatient duplication. </span> Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">easier. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Interdeveloper duplication. </span> Multiple people on a team (or on different teams)</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">duplicate a piece of information. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Let's look at these four <span class="italic">i</span>'s of duplication in more detail. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Imposed Duplication</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Sometimes, duplication seems to be forced on us. Project standards may require </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">documents that contain duplicated information, or documents that duplicate information in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the code. Multiple target platforms each require their own programming languages, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">libraries, and development environments, which makes us duplicate shared definitions and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">procedures. Programming languages themselves require certain structures that duplicate </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">information. We have all worked in situations where we felt powerless to avoid duplication. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">And yet often there are ways of keeping each piece of knowledge in one place, honoring </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the <span class="italic">DRY</span> principle, and making our lives easier at the same time. Here are some </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">techniques:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Multiple representations of information. </span> At the coding level, we often need to have</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the same information represented in different forms. Maybe we're writing a client-server </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">application, using different languages on the client and server, and need to represent some </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">shared structure on both. Perhaps we need a class whose attributes mirror the schema of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">a database table. Maybe you're writing a book and want to include excerpts of programs </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that you also will compile and test. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">With a bit of ingenuity you can normally remove the need for duplication. Often the answer </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">is to write a simple filter or code generator. Structures in multiple languages can be built </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">from a common metadata representation using a simple code generator each time the </p>

    </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">preprocessor each time we format the text. The trick is to make the process active: this </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">cannot be a one-time conversion, or we're back in a position of duplicating data. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Documentation in code. </span> Programmers are taught to comment their code: good code</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">has lots of comments. Unfortunately, they are never taught <span class="italic">why</span> code needs comments: </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">bad code <span class="italic">requires</span> lots of comments. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The <span class="italic">DRY</span> principle tells us to keep the low-level knowledge in the code, where it belongs, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and reserve the comments for other, high-level explanations. Otherwise, we're duplicating </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">knowledge, and every change means changing both the code and the comments. The </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">comments will inevitably become out of date, and untrustworthy comments are worse than </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">no comments at all. (See It's All Writing</span></span></a>, for more information on comments.)</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Documentation and code. </span> You write documentation, then you write code. Something</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">changes, and you amend the documentation and update the code. The documentation and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">code both contain representations of the same knowledge. And we all know that in the heat </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of the moment, with deadlines looming and important clients clamoring, we tend to defer </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the updating of documentation. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Dave once worked on an international telex switch. Quite understandably, the client </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">demanded an exhaustive test specification and required that the software pass all tests on </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">each delivery. To ensure that the tests accurately reflected the specification, the team </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">generated them programmatically from the document itself. When the client amended their </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">specification, the test suite changed automatically. Once the team convinced the client that </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the procedure was sound, generating acceptance tests typically took only a few seconds. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Language issues. </span> Many languages impose considerable duplication in the source. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Often this comes about when the language separates a module's interface from its </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implementation. C and C++ have header files that duplicate the names and type </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">information of exported variables, functions, and (for C++) classes. Object Pascal even </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">duplicates this information in the same file. If you are using remote procedure calls or </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">CORBA [URL 29</span></span></a>], you'll duplicate interface information between the interface specification </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and the code that implements it. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There is no easy technique for overcoming the requirements of a language. While some </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">development environments hide the need for header files by generating them </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">automatically, and Object Pascal allows you to abbreviate repeated function declarations, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you are generally stuck with what you're given. At least with most language-based issues, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">a header file that disagrees with the implementation will generate some form of compilation </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">or linkage error. You can still get things wrong, but at least you'll be told about it fairly early </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Think also about comments in header and implementation files. There is absolutely no </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">point in duplicating a function or class header comment between the two files. Use the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">header files to document interface issues, and the implementation files to document the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">nitty-gritty details that users of your code don't need to know. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Inadvertent Duplication</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Sometimes, duplication comes about as the result of mistakes in the design. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Let's look at an example from the distribution industry. Say our analysis reveals that, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">among other attributes, a truck has a type, a license number, and a driver. Similarly, a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">delivery route is a combination of a route, a truck, and a driver. We code up some classes </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">based on this understanding. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">But what happens when Sally calls in sick and we have to change drivers? Both Truck and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">DeliveryRoute contain a driver. Which one do we change? Clearly this duplication is bad. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Normalize it according to the underlying business model—does a truck really have a driver</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">as part of its underlying attribute set? Does a route? Or maybe there needs to be a third</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">object that knits together a driver, a truck, and a route. Whatever the eventual solution, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">avoid this kind of unnormalized data. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There is a slightly less obvious kind of unnormalized data that occurs when we have </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">multiple data elements that are mutually dependent. Let's look at a class representing a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">line:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">class</span> Line {</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">public:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Point start; </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Point end; </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">double</span> length; </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">}; </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">At first sight, this class might appear reasonable. A line clearly has a start and end, and will </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">always have a length (even if it's zero). But we have duplication. The length is defined by </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the start and end points: change one of the points and the length changes. It's better to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">make the length a calculated field:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">class</span> Line {</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">public:</span>

    <p class="calibre_2">Later on in the development process, you may choose to violate the <span class="italic">DRY</span> principle for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">performance reasons. Frequently this occurs when you need to cache data to avoid </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">exposed to the outside world: only the methods within the class have to worry about </p>

      <span class="bold">Impatient Duplication</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Every project has time pressures—forces that can drive the best of us to take shortcuts. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Need a routine similar to one you've written? You'll be tempted to copy the original and</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">make a few changes. Need a value to represent the maximum number of points? If I</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">change the header file, the whole project will get rebuilt. Maybe I should just use a literal</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">number here; and here; and here. Need a class like one in the Java runtime? The source is</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">available, so why not just copy it and make the changes you need (license provisions</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">notwithstanding)? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If you feel this temptation, remember the hackneyed aphorism "shortcuts make for long </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">delays." You may well save some seconds now, but at the potential loss of hours later. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Think about the issues surrounding the Y2K fiasco. Many were caused by the laziness of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">developers not parameterizing the size of date fields or implementing centralized libraries </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of date services. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Impatient duplication is an easy form to detect and handle, but it takes discipline and a </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Interdeveloper Duplication</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, perhaps the hardest type of duplication to detect and handle occurs </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">between different developers on a project. Entire sets of functionality may be inadvertently </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">duplicated, and that duplication could go undetected for years, leading to maintenance </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">problems. We heard firsthand of a U.S. state whose governmental computer systems were </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">surveyed for Y2K compliance. The audit turned up more than 10,000 programs, each </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">containing its own version of Social Security number validation. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">design. However, at the module level, the problem is more insidious. Commonly needed </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">implemented many times over. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We feel that the best way to deal with this is to encourage active and frequent</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">communication between developers. Set up forums to discuss common problems. (On</p>

    <p class="calibre_2">multiple sites—while retaining a permanent history of everything said.) Appoint a team</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">member as the project librarian, whose job is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge. Have</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">a central place in the source tree where utility routines and scripts can be deposited. And</p>

      <span class="bold">Orthogonality</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Orthogonality is a critical concept if you want to produce systems that are easy to design, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">build, test, and extend. However, the concept of orthogonality is rarely taught directly. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Often it is an implicit feature of various other methods and techniques you learn. This is a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">mistake. Once you learn to apply the principle of orthogonality directly, you'll notice an </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">immediate improvement in the quality of systems you produce. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">What Is Orthogonality? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">"Orthogonality" is a term borrowed from geometry. Two lines are orthogonal if they meet at </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">right angles, such as the axes on a graph. In vector terms, the two lines are <span class="italic">independent. </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Move along one of the lines, and your position projected onto the other doesn't change. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">In computing, the term has come to signify a kind of independence or decoupling. Two or </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others. In a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">well-designed system, the database code will be orthogonal to the user interface: you can </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">change the interface without affecting the database, and swap databases without changing </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the interface. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Before we look at the benefits of orthogonal systems, let's first look at a system that isn't </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">orthogonal. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">you try it, you discover that life isn't that simple. The helicopter's nose drops, and you start </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to spiral down to the left. Suddenly you discover that you're flying a system where every </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">control input has secondary effects. Lower the left-hand lever and you need to add </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">compensating backward movement to the right-hand stick and push the right pedal. But </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">then each of these changes affects all of the other controls again. Suddenly you're juggling </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">an unbelievably complex system, where every change impacts all the other inputs. Your </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We want to design components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">components are isolated from one another, you know that you can change one without </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">having to worry about the rest. As long as you don't change that component's external </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">interfaces, you can be comfortable that you won't cause problems that ripple through the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">entire system. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You get two major benefits if you write orthogonal systems: increased productivity and </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">forgotten—there is no need to keep changing existing code as you add new code. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">An orthogonal approach also promotes reuse. If components have specific, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">well-defined responsibilities, they can be combined with new components in ways </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that were not envisioned by their original implementors. The more loosely coupled </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your systems, the easier they are to reconfigure and reengineer. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There is a fairly subtle gain in productivity when you combine orthogonal </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">components. Assume that one component does <span class="italic">M</span> distinct things and another does </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">N</span> things. If they are orthogonal and you combine them, the result does <span class="italic">M × N</span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">things. However, if the two components are not orthogonal, there will be overlap, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and the result will do less. You get more functionality per unit effort by combining </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">orthogonal components. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Reduce Risk</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">An orthogonal approach reduces the risks inherent in any development. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Diseased sections of code are isolated. If a module is sick, it is less likely to spread </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the symptoms around the rest of the system. It is also easier to slice it out and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">transplant in something new and healthy. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The resulting system is less fragile. Make small changes and fixes to a particular </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">area, and any problems you generate will be restricted to that area. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">An orthogonal system will probably be better tested, because it will be easier to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">design and run tests on its components. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You will not be as tightly tied to a particular vendor, product, or platform, because </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the interfaces to these third-party components will be isolated to smaller parts of the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">overall development. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Let's look at some of the ways you can apply the principle of orthogonality to your work. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Project Teams</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Have you noticed how some project teams are efficient, with everyone knowing what to do </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and contributing fully, while the members of other teams are constantly bickering and don't </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">seem able to get out of each other's way? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Often this is an orthogonality issue. When teams are organized with lots of overlap, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">members are confused about responsibilities. Every change needs a meeting of the entire </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">team, because any one of them <span class="italic">might</span> be affected. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">How do you organize teams into groups with well-defined responsibilities and minimal </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">overlap? There's no simple answer. It depends partly on the project and your analysis of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the areas of potential change. It also depends on the people you have available. Our </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">preference is to start by separating infrastructure from application. Each major </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">infrastructure component (database, communications interface, middleware layer, and so </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on) gets its own subteam. Each obvious division of application functionality is similarly </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">divided. Then we look at the people we have (or plan to have) and adjust the groupings </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">accordingly. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You can get an informal measure of the orthogonality of a project team's structure. Simply </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">see how many people <span class="italic">need</span> to be involved in discussing each change that is requested. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The larger the number, the less orthogonal the group. Clearly, an orthogonal team is more </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">efficient. (Having said this, we also encourage subteams to communicate constantly with </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">each other.)</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Design</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Most developers are familiar with the need to design orthogonal systems, although they </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">may use words such as <span class="italic">modular, component-based, </span> and <span class="italic">layered</span> to describe the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">process. Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implements functionality independent of the others. Sometimes these components are </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">organized into layers, each providing a level of abstraction. This layered approach is a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">powerful way to design orthogonal systems. Because each layer uses only the abstractions </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">provided by the layers below it, you have great flexibility in changing underlying </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implementations without affecting code. Layering also reduces the risk of runaway </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">dependencies between modules. You'll often see layering expressed in diagrams such as </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">

    <p class="calibre_2">There is an easy test for orthogonal design. Once you have your components mapped out, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">ask yourself: <span class="italic">If I dramatically change the requirements behind a particular function, </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">

    <p class="calibre_2">Moving a button on a GUI panel should not require a change in the database schema. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Adding context-sensitive help should not change the billing subsystem. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">[3] In reality, this is naive. Unless you are remarkably lucky, most real-world requirements changes will</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">affect multiple functions in the system. However, if you analyze the change in terms of functions, each </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">functional change should still ideally affect just one module. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Let's consider a complex system for monitoring and controlling a heating plant. The original </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">orthogonally designed system, you would need to change only those modules associated </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">with the user interface to handle this: the underlying logic of controlling the plant would </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">remain unchanged. In fact, if you structure your system carefully, you should be able to </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">writing decoupled code using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, which works </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">well in this situation. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Toolkits and Libraries</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Be careful to preserve the orthogonality of your system as you introduce third-party toolkits </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and libraries. Choose your technologies wisely. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We once worked on a project that required that a certain body of Java code run both locally</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on a server machine and remotely on a client machine. The alternatives for distributing</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">classes this way were RMI and CORBA. If a class were made remotely accessible using</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">RMI, every call to a remote method in that class could potentially throw an exception, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">which means that a naive implementation would require us to handle the exception</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">whenever our remote classes were used. Using RMI here is clearly not orthogonal: code</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">calling our remote classes should not have to be aware of their locations. The</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">alternative—using CORBA—did not impose that restriction: we could write code that was</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">unaware of our classes' locations. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When you bring in a toolkit (or even a library from other members of your team), ask </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">yourself whether it imposes changes on your code that shouldn't be there. If an object </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">persistence scheme is transparent, then it's orthogonal. If it requires you to create or </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">access objects in a special way, then it's not. Keeping such details isolated from your code </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">has the added benefit of making it easier to change vendors in the future. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) system is an interesting example of orthogonality. In </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">most transaction-oriented systems, the application code has to delineate the start and end </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">of each transaction. With EJB, this information is expressed declaratively as metadata, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">outside any code. The same application code can run in different EJB transaction </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">environments with no change. This is likely to be a model for many future environments. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Another interesting twist on orthogonality is Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="calibre_5">
        <span class="underline">+</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">research project at Xerox Parc ([<span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">KLM 97] and [</span></span><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">URL 49]). AOP lets you express in one </span></span></a></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">place behavior that would otherwise be distributed throughout your source code. For </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">example, log messages are normally generated by sprinkling explicit calls to some log </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">function throughout your source. With AOP, you implement logging orthogonally to the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">things being logged. Using the Java version of AOP, you could write a log message when </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">entering any method of class Fred by coding the <span class="italic">aspect:</span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">aspect</span> Trace {</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">advise</span> * Fred.*(..) {</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">static before</span> {</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Log.write("-&gt; <span class="italic">Entering</span> " + thisJoinPoint.methodName); </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">}</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">}</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">}</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If you <span class="italic">weave</span> this aspect into your code, trace messages will be generated. If you don't, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you'll see no messages. Either way, your original source is unchanged. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Coding</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Every time you write code you run the risk of reducing the orthogonality of your application. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Unless you constantly monitor not just what you are doing but also the larger context of the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">application, you might unintentionally duplicate functionality in some other module, or </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">express existing knowledge twice. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There are several techniques you can use to maintain orthogonality:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Keep your code decoupled. </span> Write shy code—modules that don't reveal</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">anything unnecessary to other modules and that don't rely on other modules' </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implementations. Try the Law of Demeter <span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">[LH89], which we discuss in </span></span><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">Decoupling </span></span></a></p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">and the Law of Demeter</span></span></a>. If you need to change an object's state, get the object to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">do it for you. This way your code remains isolated from the other code's </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implementation and increases the chances that you'll remain orthogonal. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Avoid global data. </span> Every time your code references global data, it ties itself into</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the other components that share that data. Even globals that you intend only to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">read can lead to trouble (for example, if you suddenly need to change your code to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">be multithreaded). In general, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">explicitly pass any required context into your modules. In object-oriented </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">applications, context is often passed as parameters to objects' constructors. In </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">other code, you can create structures containing the context and pass around </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">references to them. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The Singleton pattern in <span class="italic">Design Patterns</span><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline"> [GHJV95</span></span>] is a way of ensuring that there</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">is only one instance of an object of a particular class. Many people use these</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">singleton objects as a kind of global variable (particularly in languages, such as</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Java, that otherwise do not support the concept of globals). Be careful with</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">singletons—they can also lead to unnecessary linkage. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Avoid similar functions. </span> Often you'll come across a set of functions that all look</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">similar—maybe they share common code at the start and end, but each has a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">different central algorithm. Duplicate code is a symptom of structural problems. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Have a look at the Strategy pattern in <span class="italic">Design Patterns</span> for a better implementation. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Get into the habit of being constantly critical of your code. Look for any opportunities to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">reorganize it to improve its structure and orthogonality. This process is called <span class="italic">refactoring, </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">and it's so important that we've dedicated a section to it (see Refactoring</span></span></a>). </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Testing</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">An orthogonally designed and implemented system is easier to test. Because the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">interactions between the system's components are formalized and limited, more of the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">system testing can be performed at the individual module level. This is good news, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">because module level (or unit) testing is considerably easier to specify and perform than </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">integration testing. In fact, we suggest that every module have its own unit test built into its </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">code, and that these tests be performed automatically as part of the regular build process </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">(see <a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">Code That's Easy to Test). </span></span></a></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Building unit tests is itself an interesting test of orthogonality. What does it take to build and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">link a unit test? Do you have to drag in a large percentage of the rest of the system just to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">get a test to compile or link? If so, you've found a module that is not well decoupled from </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the rest of the system. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Bug fixing is also a good time to assess the orthogonality of the system as a whole. When </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you come across a problem, assess how localized the fix is. Do you change just one </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">module, or are the changes scattered throughout the entire system? When you make a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">change, does it fix everything, or do other problems mysteriously arise? This is a good </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">opportunity to bring automation to bear. If you use a source code control system (and you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">will after reading <a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">Source Code Control), tag bug fixes when you check the code back in </span></span></a></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">after testing. You can then run monthly reports analyzing trends in the number of source </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">files affected by each bug fix. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Documentation</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Perhaps surprisingly, orthogonality also applies to documentation. The axes are content </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and presentation. With truly orthogonal documentation, you should be able to change the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">appearance dramatically without changing the content. Modern word processors provide </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">style sheets and macros that help (see <a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">It's All Writing). </span></span></a></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Living with Orthogonality</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Orthogonality is closely related to the <span class="italic">DRY</span> principle introduced on page 27. With <span class="italic">DRY, </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you're looking to minimize duplication within a system, whereas with orthogonality you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">reduce the interdependency among the system's components. It may be a clumsy word, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">but if you use the principle of orthogonality, combined closely with the <span class="italic">DRY</span> principle, you'll </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">find that the systems you develop are more flexible, more understandable, and easier to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">debug, test, and maintain. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If you're brought into a project where people are desperately struggling to make changes, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and where every change seems to cause four other things to go wrong, remember the </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Many of the topics in this book are geared to producing flexible, adaptable software. By</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">sticking to their recommendations—especially the <span class="italic">DRY</span> principle (page 26), decoupling</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">(page 138), and use of metadata (page 144)—we don't have to make as many critical, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">irreversible decisions. This is a good thing, because we don't always make the best</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">decisions the first time around. We commit to a certain technology only to discover we can't</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">hire enough people with the necessary skills. We lock in a certain third-party vendor just</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">before they get bought out by their competitor. Requirements, users, and hardware change</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">faster than we can get the software developed. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Suppose you decide, early in the project, to use a relational database from vendor A. Much </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">later, during performance testing, you discover that the database is simply too slow, but </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that the object database from vendor B is faster. With most conventional projects, you'd be </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">out of luck. Most of the time, calls to third-party products are entangled throughout the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">code. But if you <span class="italic">really</span> abstracted the idea of a database out—to the point where it simply</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">provides persistence as a service—then you have the flexibility to change horses in</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">midstream. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Similarly, suppose the project begins as a client-server model, but then, late in the game, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">marketing decides that servers are too expensive for some clients, and they want a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">stand-alone version. How hard would that be for you? Since it's just a deployment issue, it </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">shouldn't take more than a few days. </span> If it would take longer, then you haven't thought </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">about reversibility. The other direction is even more interesting. What if the stand-alone </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">product you are making needs to be deployed in a client-server or <span class="italic">n</span>-tier fashion? <span class="italic">That </span></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="italic">shouldn't be hard either. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The mistake lies in assuming that any decision is cast in stone—and in not preparing for</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the contingencies that might arise. Instead of carving decisions in stone, think of them</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">more as being written in the sand at the beach. A big wave can come along and wipe them</p>

      <span class="bold">Flexible Architecture</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">While many people try to keep their <span class="italic">code</span> flexible, you also need to think about maintaining </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">flexibility in the areas of architecture, deployment, and vendor integration. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Technologies such as CORBA can help insulate portions of a project from changes in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">development language or platform. Is the performance of Java on that platform not up to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">expectations? Recode the client in C++, and nothing else needs to change. Is the rules </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">engine in C++ not flexible enough? Switch over to a Smalltalk version. With a CORBA </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">architecture, you have to take a hit only for the component you are replacing; the other </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">components shouldn't be affected. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Are you developing for Unix? Which one? Do you have all of the portability concerns</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">addressed? Are you developing for a particular version of Windows? Which one—3.1, 95, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">98, NT, CE, or 2000? How hard will it be to support other versions? If you keep decisions</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">soft and pliable, it won't be hard at all. If you have poor encapsulation, high coupling, and</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">hard-coded logic or parameters in the code, it might be impossible. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Not sure how marketing wants to deploy the system? Think about it up front and you can </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">support a stand-alone, client-server, or <span class="italic">n</span>-tier model just by changing a configuration file. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We've written programs that do just that. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Normally, you can simply hide a third-party product behind a well-defined, abstract </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">interface. In fact, we've always been able to do so on any project we've worked on. But </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">suppose you couldn't isolate it that cleanly. What if you had to sprinkle certain statements </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">liberally throughout the code? Put that requirement in metadata, and use some automatic </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">mechanism, such as Aspects (see page 39) or Perl, to insert the necessary statements into </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the code itself. Whatever mechanism you use, <span class="italic">make it reversible. </span> If something is added </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">automatically, it can be taken out automatically as well. </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">There are two ways to fire a machine gun in the dark. <a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">[5]</span></span></a> You can find out exactly where</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your target is (range, elevation, and azimuth). You can determine the environmental </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">conditions (temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind, and so on). You can determine the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">precise specifications of the cartridges and bullets you are using, and their interactions with </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the actual gun you are firing. You can then use tables or a firing computer to calculate the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">exact bearing and elevation of the barrel. If everything works exactly as specified, your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">tables are correct, and the environment doesn't change, your bullets should land close to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">their target. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">[5] To be pedantic, there are many ways of firing a machine gun in the dark, including closing your eyes</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and spraying out bullets. But this is an analogy, and we're allowed to take liberties. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Or you could use tracer bullets. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Tracer bullets are loaded at intervals on the ammo belt alongside regular ammunition. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When they're fired, their phosphorus ignites and leaves a pyrotechnic trail from the gun to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">whatever they hit. If the tracers are hitting the target, then so are the regular bullets. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Not surprisingly, tracer bullets are preferred to the labor of calculation. The feedback is </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">immediate, and because they operate in the same environment as the real ammunition, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">external effects are minimized. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The analogy might be violent, but it applies to new projects, particularly when you're </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">building something that hasn't been built before. Like the gunners, you're trying to hit a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">target in the dark. Because your users have never seen a system like this before, their </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">requirements may be vague. Because you may be using algorithms, techniques, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">languages, or libraries you aren't familiar with, you face a large number of unknowns. And </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">because projects take time to complete, you can pretty much guarantee the environment </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you're working in will change before you're done. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The classic response is to specify the system to death. Produce reams of paper itemizing </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">every requirement, tying down every unknown, and constraining the environment. Fire the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">gun using dead reckoning. One big calculation up front, then shoot and hope. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Pragmatic Programmers, however, tend to prefer using tracer bullets. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Code That Glows in the Dark</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Tracer bullets work because they operate in the same environment and under the same </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">constraints as the real bullets. They get to the target fast, so the gunner gets immediate </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">feedback. And from a practical standpoint they're a relatively cheap solution. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">To get the same effect in code, we're looking for something that gets us from a requirement </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to some aspect of the final system quickly, visibly, and repeatably. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We once undertook a complex client-server database marketing project. Part of its </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">requirement was the ability to specify and execute temporal queries. The servers were a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">range of relational and specialized databases. The client GUI, written in Object Pascal, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">used a set of C libraries to provide an interface to the servers. The user's query was stored </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">on the server in a Lisp-like notation before being converted to optimized SQL just prior to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">execution. There were many unknowns and many different environments, and no one was </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">too sure how the GUI should behave. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This was a great opportunity to use tracer code. We developed the framework for the front </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">end, libraries for representing the queries, and a structure for converting a stored query into </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">a database-specific query. Then we put it all together and checked that it worked. For that </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">initial build, all we could do was submit a query that listed all the rows in a table, but it </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">proved that the UI could talk to the libraries, the libraries could serialize and unserialize a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">query, and the server could generate SQL from the result. Over the following months we </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">gradually fleshed out this basic structure, adding new functionality by augmenting each </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">component of the tracer code in parallel. When the UI added a new query type, the library </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">grew and the SQL generation was made more sophisticated. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Tracer code is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has. It </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">simply is not fully functional. However, once you have achieved an end-to-end connection </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">among the components of your system, you can check how close to the target you are, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">adjusting if necessary. Once you're on target, adding functionality is easy. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Tracer development is consistent with the idea that a project is never finished: there will </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">always be changes required and functions to add. It is an incremental approach. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The conventional alternative is a kind of heavy engineering approach: code is divided into </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">modules, which are coded in a vacuum. Modules are combined into subassemblies, which </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">are then further combined, until one day you have a complete application. Only then can </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the application as a whole be presented to the user and tested. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The tracer code approach has many advantages:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Users get to see something working early. </span> If you have successfully</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">communicated what you are doing (see <a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">Great Expectations), your users will know </span></span></a></p>
    <p class="calibre_2">they are seeing something immature. They won't be disappointed by a lack of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">functionality; they'll be ecstatic to see some visible progress toward their system. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">They also get to contribute as the project progresses, increasing their buy-in. These </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">same users will likely be the people who'll tell you how close to the target each </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">iteration is. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Developers build a structure to work in. </span> The most daunting piece of paper is</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the one with nothing written on it. If you have worked out all the end-to-end </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">interactions of your application, and have embodied them in code, then your team </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">won't need to pull as much out of thin air. This makes everyone more productive, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and encourages consistency. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">You have an integration platform. </span> As the system is connected end-to-end, you</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">have an environment to which you can add new pieces of code once they have </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">been unit-tested. Rather than attempting a big-bang integration, you'll be </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">integrating every day (often many times a day). The impact of each new change is </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">more apparent, and the interactions are more limited, so debugging and testing are </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">faster and more accurate. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">You have something to demonstrate. </span> Project sponsors and top brass have a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">tendency to want to see demos at the most inconvenient times. With tracer code, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you'll always have something to show them. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">You have a better feel for progress. </span> In a tracer code development, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">developers tackle use cases one by one. When one is done, they move to the next. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It is far easier to measure performance and to demonstrate progress to your user. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Because each individual development is smaller, you avoid creating those </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">monolithic blocks of code that are reported as 95% complete week after week. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Tracer Bullets Don't Always Hit Their Target</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Tracer bullets show what you're hitting. This may not always be the target. You then adjust </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your aim until they're on target. That's the point. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It's the same with tracer code. You use the technique in situations where you're not 100%</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">certain of where you're going. You shouldn't be surprised if your first couple of attempts</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">miss: the user says "that's not what I meant," or data you need isn't available when you</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">need it, or performance problems seem likely. Work out how to change what you've got to</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">bring it nearer the target, and be thankful that you've used a lean development</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">methodology. A small body of code has low inertia—it is easy and quick to change. You'll</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">be able to gather feedback on your application and generate a new, more accurate version</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">faster and at less cost than with any other method. And because every major application</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">component is represented in your tracer code, your users can be confident that what</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">they're seeing is based on reality, not just a paper specification. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Tracer Code versus Prototyping</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You might think that this tracer code concept is nothing more than prototyping under an </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">aggressive name. There is a difference. With a prototype, you're aiming to explore specific </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">aspects of the final system. With a true prototype, you will throw away whatever you lashed </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">together when trying out the concept, and recode it properly using the lessons you've </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">learned. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">For example, say you're producing an application that helps shippers determine how to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">pack odd-sized boxes into containers. Among other problems, the user interface needs to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">be intuitive and the algorithms you use to determine optimal packing are very complex. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You could prototype a user interface for your end users in a GUI tool. You code only </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">enough to make the interface responsive to user actions. Once they've agreed to the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">layout, you might throw it away and recode it, this time with the business logic behind it, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">using the target language. Similarly, you might want to prototype a number of algorithms </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that perform the actual packing. You might code functional tests in a high-level, forgiving </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">language such as Perl, and code low-level performance tests in something closer to the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">machine. In any case, once you'd made your decision, you'd start again and code the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <img class="calibre_6" src="images/00297.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <img class="calibre_1" src="images/00202.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">algorithms in their final environment, interfacing to the real world. This is <span class="italic">prototyping, </span> and it </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">is very useful. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The tracer code approach addresses a different problem. You need to know how the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">application as a whole hangs together. You want to show your users how the interactions </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">will work in practice, and you want to give your developers an architectural skeleton on </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">which to hang code. In this case, you might construct a tracer consisting of a trivial </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implementation of the container packing algorithm (maybe something like first-come, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">first-served) and a simple but working user interface. Once you have all the components in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the application plumbed together, you have a framework to show your users and your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">developers. Over time, you add to this framework with new functionality, completing </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">stubbed routines. But the framework stays intact, and you know the system will continue to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">behave the way it did when your first tracer code was completed. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The distinction is important enough to warrant repeating. Prototyping generates disposable </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">code. Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Think of prototyping as the reconnaissance and intelligence gathering that takes place </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">before a single tracer bullet is fired. </p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Many different industries use prototypes to try out specific ideas; prototyping is much</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">cheaper than full-scale production. Car makers, for example, may build many different</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">prototypes of a new car design. Each one is designed to test a specific aspect of the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">car—the aerodynamics, styling, structural characteristics, and so on. Perhaps a clay model</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">will be built for wind tunnel testing, maybe a balsa wood and duct tape model will do for the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">art department, and so on. Some car companies take this a step further, and now do a</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">great deal of modeling work on the computer, reducing costs even further. In this way, risky</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">or uncertain elements can be tried out without committing to building the real item. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We build software prototypes in the same fashion, and for the same reasons—to analyze</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and expose risk, and to offer chances for correction at a greatly reduced cost. Like the car</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">makers, we can target a prototype to test one or more specific aspects of a project. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We tend to think of prototypes as code-based, but they don't always have to be. Like the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">car makers, we can build prototypes out of different materials. Post-it notes are great for </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">prototyping dynamic things such as workflow and application logic. A user interface can be </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">prototyped as a drawing on a whiteboard, as a nonfunctional mock-up drawn with a paint </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">program, or with an interface builder. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Prototypes are designed to answer just a few questions, so they are much cheaper and</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">faster to develop than applications that go into production. The code can ignore</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">unimportant details—unimportant to you at the moment, but probably very important to the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">user later on. If you are prototyping a GUI, for instance, you can get away with incorrect</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">results or data. On the other hand, if you're just investigating computational or performance</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">aspects, you can get away with a pretty poor GUI, or perhaps even no GUI at all. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">But if you find yourself in an environment where you <span class="italic">cannot</span> give up the details, then you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">need to ask yourself if you are really building a prototype at all. Perhaps a tracer bullet </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">Prototype to Learn</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">How to Use Prototypes</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When building a prototype, what details can you ignore? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Correctness. </span> You may be able to use dummy data where appropriate. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Completeness. </span> The prototype may function only in a very limited sense, perhaps</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">with only one preselected piece of input data and one menu item. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Robustness. </span> Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely. If you</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">stray from the predefined path, the prototype may crash and burn in a glorious </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">display of pyrotechnics. That's okay. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Style. </span> It is painful to admit this in print, but prototype code probably doesn't have</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">much in the way of comments or documentation. You may produce reams of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">documentation as a result of your experience with the prototype, but comparatively </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">very little on the prototype system itself. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Since a prototype should gloss over details, and focus in on specific aspects of the system</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">being considered, you may want to implement prototypes using a very high-level</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">language—higher than the rest of the project (maybe a language such as Perl, Python, or</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Tcl). A high-level scripting language lets you defer many details (including specifying data</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">types) and still produce a functional (albeit incomplete or slow) piece of code<a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">.[6] If you nee</span></span></a>d</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to prototype user interfaces, investigate tools such as Tcl/Tk, Visual Basic, Powerbuilder, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">or Delphi. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">[6] If you are investigating absolute (instead of relative) performance, you will need to stick to a language</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that is close in performance to the target language. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Scripting languages work well as the "glue" to combine low-level pieces into new</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">combinations. Under Windows, Visual Basic can glue together COM controls. More</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">generally, you can use languages such as Perl and Python to bind together low-level C</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">libraries—either by hand, or automatically with tools such as the freely available SWIG</p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">[URL 28</span></span></a>]. Using this approach, you can rapidly assemble existing components into new </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">configurations to see how things work. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Prototyping Architecture</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Many prototypes are constructed to model the entire system under consideration. As</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">opposed to tracer bullets, none of the individual modules in the prototype system need to</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">be particularly functional. In fact, you may not even need to code in order to prototype</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">architecture—you can prototype on a whiteboard, with Post-it notes or index cards. What</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">you are looking for is how the system hangs together as a whole, again deferring details. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Here are some specific areas you may want to look for in the architectural prototype:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Are the responsibilities of the major components well defined and appropriate? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Are the collaborations between major components well defined? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Is coupling minimized? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Can you identify potential sources of duplication? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Are interface definitions and constraints acceptable? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Does every module have an access path to the data it needs during execution? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Does it have that access <span class="italic">when</span> it needs it? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This last item tends to generate the most surprises and the most valuable results from the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">prototyping experience. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">How Not to Use Prototypes</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Before you embark on any code-based prototyping, make sure that everyone understands </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that you are writing disposable code. Prototypes can be deceptively attractive to people </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">who don't know that they are just prototypes. You must make it <span class="italic">very</span> clear that this code is </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">disposable, incomplete, and unable to be completed. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It's easy to become misled by the apparent completeness of a demonstrated prototype, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and project sponsors or management may insist on deploying the prototype (or its progeny) </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">if you don't set the right expectations. Remind them that you can build a great prototype of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">a new car out of balsa wood and duct tape, but you wouldn't try to drive it in rush-hour </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">traffic! </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If you feel there is a strong possibility in your environment or culture that the purpose of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">prototype code may be misinterpreted, you may be better off with the tracer bullet </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">approach. You'll end up with a solid framework on which to base future development. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">When used properly, a prototype can save you huge amounts of time, money, pain, and</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">suffering by identifying and correcting potential problem spots early in the development</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">cycle—the time when fixing mistakes is both cheap and easy. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">When you listen to users of a proposed system, they might be able to tell you exactly how </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">code. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">After you've written the application, the users give you a new requirement: transactions </p>

      <span class="bold">Implementing a Mini-Language</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">At its simplest, a mini-language may be in a line-oriented, easily parsed format. In practice, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">we probably use this form more than any other. It can be parsed simply using switch</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">statements, or using regular expressions in scripting languages such as Perl. The answer </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to Exercise 5 on page 281 shows a simple implementation in C. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You can also implement a more complex language, with a more formal syntax. The trick </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">here is to define the syntax first using a notation such as BNF.[7]</span></span></a> Once you have your</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">grammar specified, it is normally trivial to convert it into the input syntax for a parser </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">generator. C and C++ programmers have been using yacc (or its freely available </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implementation, bison<a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline"> [URL 27</span></span></a>]) for years. These programs are documented in detail in the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">book <span class="italic">Lex and Yacc</span><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline"> [LMB92</span></span>]. Java programmers can try javaCC, which can be found at </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">[URL 26</span></span></a>]. The answer to Exercise 7 on page 282 shows a parser written using bison. As it </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">shows, once you know the syntax, it's really not a lot of work to write simple </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">mini-languages. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">The languages you implement can be used in two different ways. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Data languages</span> produce some form of data structure used by an application. These </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">languages are often used to represent configuration information. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">For example, the sendmail program is used throughout the world for routing e-mail over the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Internet. It has many excellent features and benefits, which are controlled by a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">thousand-line configuration file, written using sendmail's own configuration language:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Mlocal, P=/usr/bin/procmail, </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">When the application determines it is time to enter a Social Security number, it invokes the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">interpreter on this script, which then controls the transaction. If the interpreter is embedded </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">within the application, the two can even share data directly (for example, via a callback </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">mechanism). </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Here you're programming in the maintenance programmer's domain. When the mainframe </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">application changes, and the fields move around, the programmer can simply update your </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">high-level description, rather than groveling around in the details of C code. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Stand-Alone and Embedded Languages</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">A mini-language doesn't have to be used directly by the application to be useful. Many </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">times we may use a specification language to create artifacts (including metadata) that are </p>
    <p class="calibre_2"><a href="#filepos109"><span class="calibre_5"><span class="underline">compiled, read-in, or otherwise used by the program itself (see Metaprogramming</span></span></a>). </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">For example, on page 100 we describe a system in which we used Perl to generate a large</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">number of derivations from an original schema specification. We invented a common</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">language to express the database schema, and then generated all the forms of it we</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">needed—SQL, C, Web pages, XML, and others. The application didn't use the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">specification directly, but it relied on the output produced from it. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">It is common to embed high-level imperative languages directly into your application, so </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">that they execute when your code runs. This is clearly a powerful capability; you can </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">change your application's behavior by changing the scripts it reads, all without compiling. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This can significantly simplify maintenance in a dynamic application domain. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Easy Development or Easy Maintenance? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">We've looked at several different grammars, ranging from simple line-oriented formats to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">more complex grammars that look like real languages. Since it takes extra effort to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">implement, why would you choose a more complex grammar? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The trade-off is extendibility and maintenance. While the code for parsing a "real" language</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">may be harder to write, it will be much easier for people to understand, and to extend in the</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">future with new features and functionality. Languages that are too simple may be easy to</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">parse, but can be cryptic—much like the sendmail example on page 60. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Given that most applications exceed their expected lifetimes, you're probably better off </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">biting the bullet and adopting the more complex and readable language up front. The initial </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">effort will be repaid many times in reduced support and maintenance costs. </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">By learning to estimate, and by developing this skill to the point where you have an intuitive </p>

      <span class="bold">How Accurate Is Accurate Enough? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">To some extent, all answers are estimates. It's just that some are more accurate than </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">others. So the first question you have to ask yourself when someone asks you for an </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">estimate is the context in which your answer will be taken. Do they need high accuracy, or </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">are they looking for a ballpark figure? </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">If your grandmother asks when you will arrive, she's probably wondering whether to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">make you lunch or dinner. On the other hand, a diver trapped underwater and </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">running out of air is probably interested in an answer down to the second. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">What's the value of p? If you're wondering how much edging to buy to put around a </p>

    <p class="calibre_2">maybe "22/7" is a good approximation. If you're in NASA, then maybe 12 decimal </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">places will do. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">[10] "3" is also apparently good enough if you are a legislator. In 1897, Indiana State</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Legislature House Bill No. 246 attempted to decree that henceforth p should have the value of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">"3". The Bill was tabled indefinitely at its second reading when a mathematics professor </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">pointed out that their powers did not quite extend to passing laws of nature. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">One of the interesting things about estimating is that the units you use make a difference in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the interpretation of the result. If you say that something will take about 130 working days, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">then people will be expecting it to come in pretty close. However, if you say "Oh, about six </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">months," then they know to look for it any time between five and seven months from now. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Both numbers represent the same duration, but "130 days" probably implies a higher </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">degree of accuracy than you feel. We recommend that you scale time estimates as follows:</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Duration</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Quote estimate in</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">1-15 days</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">days</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">3-8 weeks</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">weeks</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">8-30 weeks</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">months</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">30+ weeks</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">think hard before giving an estimate</p>
    <p class="calibre_2">So, if after doing all the necessary work, you decide that a project will take 125 working </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">days (25 weeks), you might want to deliver an estimate of "about six months." </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The same concepts apply to estimates of any quantity: choose the units of your answer to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">reflect the accuracy you intend to convey. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Where Do Estimates Come From? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">All estimates are based on models of the problem. But before we get too deeply into the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">techniques of building models, we have to mention a basic estimating trick that always </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">gives good answers: ask someone who's already done it. Before you get too committed to </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">model building, cast around for someone who's been in a similar situation in the past. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">See how their problem got solved. It's unlikely you'll ever find an exact match, but you'd be </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">surprised how many times you can successfully draw on other's experiences. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Understand What's Being Asked</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">The first part of any estimation exercise is building an understanding of what's being asked. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">As well as the accuracy issues discussed above, you need to have a grasp of the scope of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the domain. Often this is implicit in the question, but you need to make it a habit to think </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">about the scope before starting to guess. Often, the scope you choose will form part of the </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">answer you give: "Assuming there are no traffic accidents and there's gas in the car, I </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">should be there in 20 minutes." </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Build a Model of the System</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">This is the fun part of estimating. From your understanding of the question being asked, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">build a rough and ready bare-bones mental model. If you're estimating response times, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">your model may involve a server and some kind of arriving traffic. For a project, the model </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">may be the steps that your organization uses during development, along with a very rough </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">picture of how the system might be implemented. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Model building can be both creative and useful in the long term. Often, the process of </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">building the model leads to discoveries of underlying patterns and processes that weren't </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">apparent on the surface. You may even want to reexamine the original question: "You </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">asked for an estimate to do <span class="italic">X. </span> However, it looks like <span class="italic">Y, </span> a variant of <span class="italic">X, </span> could be done in </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">about half the time, and you lose only one feature." </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Building the model introduces inaccuracies into the estimating process. This is inevitable, </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">and also beneficial. You are trading off model simplicity for accuracy. Doubling the effort on </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the model may give you only a slight increase in accuracy. Your experience will tell you </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">when to stop refining. </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">
      <span class="bold">Break the Model into Components</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">Once you have a model, you can decompose it into components. You'll need to discover </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">the mathematical rules that describe how these components interact. Sometimes a </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">component contributes a single value that is added into the result. Some components may </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">supply multiplying factors, while others may be more complicated (such as those that </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">simulate the arrival of traffic at a node). </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">You'll find that each component will typically have parameters that affect how it contributes </p>
    <p class="calibre_2">to the overall model. At this stage, simply identify each parameter. </p>
